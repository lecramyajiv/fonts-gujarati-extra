Shrikhand is the name of a sweet and creamy Gujarati dessert that is a particular favourite of the design, Jonny Pinhorn.

Shrikhand is a sort of Gujarati Cooper Black. 
In the three or four years prior to the initial development of this font in June 2015, Jonny lived in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, working for Indian Type Foundry. 
During this time India had a profound effect on his design philosophy and general worldview. 
Shrikhand is the culmination of three years absorbing the colourful and vibrant hand-painted lettering that can be seen on the streets of Gujarat. 
Big, bold, and unapologetic, Shrikhand is a display type that evolved from discussions with colleagues about how good the Gujarati script looks when it is free to be as curvatious and expressive as possible.

Shrikhand fully supports both the Gujarati and Latin writing systems and is freely available under the SIL Open Font License. 
As with all of Jonny's type design projects, Shrikhand is fully Unicode compliant and includes OpenType features, including some stylised contextual alternates that add flair and spontaneity.

Testing documents are available from the `gh-pages` branch and online at [jonpinhorn.github.io/shrikhand](http://jonpinhorn.github.io/shrikhand)
